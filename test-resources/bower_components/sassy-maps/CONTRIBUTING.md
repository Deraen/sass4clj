## Contributing to Sassy Maps

We love contributors! Yes we do! If you would like to contribute to Sassy Maps, please follow the following guidelines:

* **DO NOT ISSUE A PULL REQUEST WITHOUT RELATED ISSUE!!** All pull requests must reference an issue in the issue queue and will only be looked at after discussion about that issue has taken place. Any pull request created that does not reference an issue will be closed.
* Each individual feature you would like add, or bug you would like to squash, should be an individual pull request. Each pull request should be from an individual feature branch to either the latest stable or development branch. **The current *stable* branch is 0.x.x. The current *development* branch is 0.x.x**. Contributions that are not in the form of a pull request will not be considered. If your pull request does not apply cleanly we will ask you to fix that before we will look into pulling it in. We may ask you to update or make changes to the code you've submitted, please don't take this the wrong way. If a pull request smells (such as if a large amount of code is all within a single commit, or the coding standards aren't in line with core Singularity) we may ask you to rewrite your commit.
